I prefer to make this repository for upgrading my hard skills as Full-Stack Development.
This was made from my old experiences when I was in the university at 4th years academy, But this is just my fun.

# Fronted DUMP
# Running npm install to make them all up to date
`npm install`

# My API will be provide later on...
